## Example config for project setup
### Python
Python has shifted toward a more unified configuration approach recently, but you'll still see a mix of old and new.

* pyproject.toml: The modern standard for defining build systems and project metadata.
* requirements.txt: A simple list of dependencies for pip.
* setup.py / setup.cfg: Legacy files for packaging and distribution.
* environment.yml: Used specifically for Conda virtual environments.
* tox.ini: Configuration for automated testing across different Python versions.

### Java
Java relies heavily on established build automation tools.

* pom.xml: The core configuration file for Maven projects.
* build.gradle: The build script for Gradle (Groovy DSL).
* settings.gradle: Defines project structure and module names for Gradle.
* MANIFEST.MF: Defines extension and package-related data for JAR files.

### Go (Golang)
Go keeps it minimal with a focus on reproducibility.

* go.mod: Defines the module's path and its dependency requirements.
* go.sum: Contains the expected cryptographic hashes of the content of specific module versions.

### Ruby
Ruby’s ecosystem is centered around "Gems."
Gemfile: Describes the gem dependencies required to run the Ruby code.

* Gemfile.lock: Records the exact versions of gems that were installed.
* .ruby-version: Specifies which version of the Ruby interpreter should be used.
* Rakefile: Contains instructions for rake (Ruby's build program).

### Node.js
The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem is highly standardized.

* package.json: Manifest file containing metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
* package-lock.json (or yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml): Ensures consistent installation across machines.
* tsconfig.json: Configuration for TypeScript compiler settings.
* .npmrc: Configuration file for how npm should behave.

### Rust
Rust uses a single, powerful tool called Cargo.

* Cargo.toml: The manifest file where you declare dependencies and metadata.
* Cargo.lock: Created automatically to ensure reproducible builds by locking dependency versions.

### Kotlin
Since Kotlin is often used in the JVM or Android ecosystem, it shares tools with Java but uses its own "flavor."
* build.gradle.kts: Gradle build script using the Kotlin DSL.
* settings.gradle.kts: Project-wide settings using Kotlin DSL.

### PHP
Modern PHP development revolves around Composer.
* composer.json: Defines dependencies, autoloading rules, and project metadata.
* composer.lock: Locks the project to specific versions of dependencies.
* php.ini: The main configuration file for the PHP interpreter itself.

### C / C++
These languages are more fragmented, often depending on the build system chosen.

* Makefile: Used by the make build automation tool.
* CMakeLists.txt: Configuration for CMake, the industry standard for cross-platform C/C++ builds.
* conanfile.txt / conanfile.py: Used by the Conan package manager.
* vcpkg.json: Configuration for the vcpkg dependency manager.

### Visual Studio (IDE Specific)
While the languages above use the files listed, the Visual Studio IDE adds its own layer.
* .sln: The Solution file; acts as a container for one or more projects.
* .csproj / .vcxproj: Project files for C# and C++ respectively, containing build settings and file references.
* .editorconfig: Defines coding styles (indentation, etc.) to be enforced by the editor.
* App.config / Web.config: XML files for runtime configuration settings.
