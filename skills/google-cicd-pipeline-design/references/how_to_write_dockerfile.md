#  Comprehensive Guide to Writing Dockerfiles

This document is a detailed guideline for writing professional-grade Dockerfiles


## 1. Core Principles: Thinking in Layers

A Docker image is a stack of read-only layers. Each instruction (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new layer.

* **Optimize the Cache:** Order instructions from **least frequent to most frequent change**.
* *Bad:* Copying all source code, then running `npm install`. (Cache busts on every code change).
* *Good:* Copy `package.json`, run `install`, *then* copy source code.
* *Install dependencies first:* For all languages, install dependencies before copying source code. This leverages Docker's layer caching.

* **Combine RUN commands:** Use `&&` and line breaks (`\`) to group related commands (e.g., `apt-get update && apt-get install -y ... && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) to keep the layer count and image size down.

## 2. General Best Practices

* **Sort Multi-line arguments:** When writing RUN commands with multiple arguments, sort them alphabetically to improve readability and maintainability.
* **COPY vs ADD:** Always use `COPY`. Use `ADD` only if you need to auto-extract a local `.tar` file into the image.
* **Use `.dockerignore`:** Create this file to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, logs, and secrets from being sent to the Docker daemon. This speeds up builds and increases security.
* **Run as Non-Root:** By default, containers run as root. For production, create a user with a UID above 10,000 to prevent host-escalation attacks.
```dockerfile
RUN groupadd -g 10001 appgroup && useradd -u 10000 -g appgroup appuser
USER appuser

```

## 3. Multi-Stage Builds (The Gold Standard)

Multi-stage builds allow you to use a heavy image (with compilers and build tools) for the build process and a tiny image (just the runtime) for the final production container.
Always use multi stage builds when possible.
### Why use Multi-Stage?

1. **Drastic Size Reduction:** Your final image won't contain compilers, header files, or build caches.
2. **Security:** Fewer binaries in the final image mean a smaller attack surface.
3. **Simplicity:** You don't need separate build scripts; the entire CI/CD pipeline is documented in one Dockerfile.

### 💡 Example 1: Node.js (Standard Production Pattern)

This pattern separates the `npm install` (with dev dependencies for building) from the production runtime.

```dockerfile
# --- Stage 1: Build & Test ---
FROM node:22-bookworm AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci  # Clean install including dev dependencies
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# --- Stage 2: Production Runtime ---
FROM node:22-bookworm-slim AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
# Only copy production dependencies and the built dist folder
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

USER node
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

```

### 💡 Example 2: Go (Compiled to Distroless/Scratch)

For compiled languages like Go, Rust, or C++, the final image can be effectively "empty" except for your binary.

```dockerfile
# --- Stage 1: Build ---
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
# Build a statically linked binary
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /bin/app ./main.go

# --- Stage 2: Runtime ---
# Using Google's "distroless" for maximum security (no shell, no package manager)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12
COPY --from=builder /bin/app /app
USER 1000:1000
ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]

```

## 4. Google Cloud Run Specifics

If you are deploying to **Google Cloud Run**, you can leverage advanced features for security and maintenance.

### Base Image for Cloud Run Automatic Updates

Google Cloud can automatically patch security vulnerabilities in your base image if you follow the **"Scratch Pattern"**.

1. In your Dockerfile, copy your app onto a `FROM scratch` image.
2. Deploy to Cloud Run using the `--base-image` flag.

**Dockerfile for Cloud Run Automatic Updates:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:24-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production
COPY . .

# Final stage: Start from scratch (Cloud Run will inject the OS/Runtime layers)
FROM scratch
WORKDIR /workspace
# Note: chown 33:33 is a common pattern for the 'www-data' user in Google's stacks
COPY --from=builder --chown=33:33 /usr/src/app/ ./
USER 33:33
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]

```

### Recommended Base Images (Stacks)

A base image serves as the starting foundation for container-based development. You build your application by layering necessary libraries, binaries, and configuration files on top of this image. Google Cloud's buildpacks publish these images with various configurations for system packages and languages.

#### Key Guidelines

* **Hosting**: Base images are hosted in every region where the Artifact Registry is available.
* **Updates**: Security and maintenance updates are released routinely. Depending on your environment (e.g., Cloud Run functions) and configuration, these updates can be applied automatically or manually.
* **URI Format**: To use a base image, you reference it using a specific URI structure which you can customize based on your location and requirements: REGION-docker.pkg.dev/serverless-runtimes/STACK/runtimes/RUNTIME_ID

**Customization Steps** You need to replace the specific portions of the URI with your own values:

* **REGION**: Replace with your preferred region (e.g., us-central1).
* **STACK**: Replace with your preferred operating system stack (e.g., google-24).
* **RUNTIME_ID**: Replace with the specific ID for your language runtime (e.g., python313 or nodejs24). Detailed list of runtime ids is below:


Runtime IDs and environment details (mostly Ubuntu 22.04 or 18.04, with some newer Ubuntu 24.04 options) for the following languages:

## 5. Summary Checklist

| Feature | Best Practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Base Image** | Use official, versioned, slim, or distroless images. |
| **Layers** | Combine `RUN` commands; copy dependencies before source code. |
| **Security** | Prefer not to run as `root`; never include secrets/ENV keys in Dockerfile. |
| **Size** | Use **Multi-Stage builds** to strip out build-time bloat. |
| **Cloud Run** | Use `runtime provided` + base images |
| **Metadata** | Use `LABEL` to provide contact and versioning info. |
